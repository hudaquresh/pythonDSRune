Important Notes to Consider

- Sequential Search is O(n) on an ordered and unordered list
- A binary search is O(n) in a worst case ordered list no? but the book says O(log(n))
- Hash tables provide us with constant time searching 
- Bubble, selection, and insertion are O(n^2) 
- Shell is between O(n) and O(n^2) 
- Merge O(nlogn) but needs more space
- Quick O(nlogn) but O(n^2) if splitpoints to near beginning does not require addtional space
